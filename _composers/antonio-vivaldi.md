# Antonio Vivaldi

## About the composer

Antonio Vivaldi (1678 – 1741) was probably born in Venice, Italy. The priest Vivaldi, in view of his wild red hair often called “the red priest” (Il Preto Rosso), worked the largest part of his life as a music master at the *Ospedale della Pietà* in Venice, originally an orphanage for extra-marital girls. For an important part this may not only have influenced the score of his works (there were only women to play and sing), but could also be the reason for the fact that he frequently made use of easy to listen to melodies, as these were mostly intended for a young female audience. His most famous work, of course, is *Le Quattro Stagioni* (The Four Seasons). He died in Vienna, during one of his journeys. The first movement of Vivaldi’s Stabat Mater has been used in the soundtrack of the movie “The talented Mr.Ripley”.

## About the Stabat Mater

| Field | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Date** | ca. 1727 |
| **Performers** | Alto, strings and continuo |
| **Length** | CD 1: 21.21 minutes,  CD 2: 18.37 minutes and CD 3: 18.30 minutes |
| **Particulars** | The composition is divided into eight sections. The melodies of sections 1 to 3 are repeated in sections 4 to 6. For me, this Stabat Mater is one of the most beautiful ever composed. The singers in the first two registrations that I possess differ greatly with respect to their voices, but both sing marvelous. You should hear them both! |
| **Textual variations** | Only the first ten stanzas are used. It seems that for some time shorter versions of the Stabat Mater were used as a hymn for Vespers for the Friday after Holy Week. |
