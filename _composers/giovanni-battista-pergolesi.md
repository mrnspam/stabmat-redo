Pergolesi's *Stabat Mater* is among the most celebrated Baroque settings of the text. Composed in 1736 for the Confraternita dei Cavalieri di San Luigi di Palazzo, it replaced Alessandro Scarlatti's earlier version and quickly spread across Europe. Its alternation of soloists and delicate string writing remains a cornerstone of the repertoire.
