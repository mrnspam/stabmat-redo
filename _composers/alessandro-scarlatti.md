Commissioned by the confraternity of the Chiesa di San Luigi di Palazzo, Scarlatti's version predates Pergolesi's setting and provided the template for later commissions. Its twelve movements alternate solo and duet textures with expressive string accompaniments that bridge late Baroque and Neapolitan styles.
