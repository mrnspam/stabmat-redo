<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why this Stabat Mater website?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Initiator of this website, <a href="{{ '/stabat-mater-foundation/' | relative_url }}">Hans van der Velden</a>, began this journey of musical discovery in 1992 with the Stabat Mater from <a href="{{ '/stabat-mater-foundation/' | relative_url }}">Haydn</a>. He searched systematically and persistently for composers, performances on cd and translations of the original Latin poem. He brought the religious, literary, and musical world of the Stabat Mater to life. <a href="{{ '/stabat-mater-foundation/' | relative_url }}">We are proud</a> to continue his work.</p>
