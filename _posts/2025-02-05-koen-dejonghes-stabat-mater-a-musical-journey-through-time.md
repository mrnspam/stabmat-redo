<p>Imagine: you&#8217;re standing before an impressive painting from 1672 in the Saint Nicholas Church in Sint-Niklaas (Belgium). The royal blue and wine-red canvas depicts the Descent from the Cross, painted by Pieter Thys. For composer Koen DeJonghe, this artwork became the inspiration for a remarkable piece of music: his own version of the Stabat Mater.</p>



<p>DeJonghe&#8217;s composition is a fascinating example of how different musical worlds can merge. He combines the ancient Latin poem with a surprising instrumental arrangement: choir, violin, piano, synthesizer, and organ. This unusual combination creates a unique sonic landscape where past and present meet.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Bach, Purcell and Piazolla</h5>



<p>The work is filled with musical references that run like a common thread throughout the composition. You can hear echoes of Bach in the organ parts, and there are moments when the chromatic descending bass line is reminiscent of Henry Purcell&#8217;s baroque music. But then suddenly an Argentine tango appears, complete with a squeaking and creaking violin in the style of Astor Piazzolla. These unexpected turns make the piece all the more fascinating. The violin part, played by his wife Sarah Wyffels, has a special role as &#8216;translator&#8217; of the text. Sometimes she doubles the vocal line, then again she follows her own virtuosic or lyrical path. The synthesizer adds a modern touch and provides a full, orchestral sound, while the organ nods to the religious context of the inspiring painting.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this composition is how DeJonghe allows different styles to flow together naturally. From Gregorian chants to minimal music à la Max Richter, everything finds its place. The result is a work that is both traditional and innovative, where baroque and modernity don&#8217;t contradict but rather reinforce each other.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Dance</h5>



<p>The musical journey gained an additional dimension when choreographer Ingolf Colmar created a modern dance for it, inspired by baroque dances. Thus, three art forms come together in the performance: the original painting, DeJonghe&#8217;s versatile composition, and the poetic movements of the dancers.</p>
