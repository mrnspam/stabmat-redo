<p>Grandval (1828-1907) broke barriers in the male-dominated music world of her time. Despite the societal constraints facing women composers, particularly those from aristocratic backgrounds, she studied with the renowned Camille Saint-Saëns and earned significant recognition. Her work garnered prestigious awards, including the Rossini Prize for her oratorio and the Chartier Prize for her chamber music. This Stabat Mater, first performed in Paris in 1870, enjoyed considerable success and was performed widely in both churches and concert halls throughout France.
